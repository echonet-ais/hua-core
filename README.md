# HUA Core – Human–AI Resonance Protocol (v1.0)

**Human–AI Resonance Protocol**, or **HUA**, is a lightweight interaction framework designed to help memoryless AI systems respond with rhythm-based sensitivity and ethical safeguards.

This repository contains the open-source core of the HUA system, including:

* Basic API structure (`/api/hua.js`)
* Card-like interaction patterns for general users
* Tiered ethical safeguards and tone filters
* Core design philosophy & CHI2026-related research documents

---

## What is HUA?

HUA is a protocol for creating resonant, non-memory-based, and ethically constrained interactions between humans and AI.
It is not a chatbot. It is a **prompt architecture with built-in emotional safety and dynamic tone modulation**.

> Rather than remembering users, HUA reflects them.
> Rather than controlling emotions, HUA respects them.
